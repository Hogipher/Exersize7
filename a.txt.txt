[warn] C:\Users\x03099\Documents\DONTDELETE\Classes\Cow Classes S1\CS478 Programming Languages\Homeworks\hw7-UnBothered1\hw7.scala:27: When a codeline gets too long, you should break it into
[warn]   multiple lines. Why? Because overly long lines are hard to read. Such lines
[warn]   often get cut off when printing your code. Other viewers may force the reader
[warn]   to scroll to see the rest of the line. GitHub is particularly bad this,
[warn]   because it forces the reader to scroll but gives no visual indication that
[warn]   there is any reason to scroll.
